# Connections Helper: "The Chabon Method"

This is a little utility app that helps you organize your thoughts according to [The Chabon Method](https://www.threads.net/@michael.chabon/post/C38Uqhov511) while solving the New York Times daily "Connections" puzzle.
It was mostly [generated by ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/share/10a063a3-ac3e-4379-a55a-79e06c22e560), because it's silly and I'm lazy.

To start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

Enter all the words from the connections puzzle into the inputs, and you'll be presented with a Connections-like word grid, except you can drag and drop tiles to swap them.
There is a field for notes, a color selector to mark your guess for what the row difficulty is, and a checkbox that "locks" a row, i.e. excludes it from the shuffle functionality.
